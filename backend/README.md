# Express.js

This template provides a minimal setup for an Express.js server.

# Getting Started

To start developing, do the following:
- Add a .env file to this directory. Add a variable named "MONGODB_URI" with the value "mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.j5t8r.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0" (after replacing username and password with a valid set of credentials).
- Open a terminal in this directory.
- Run 'npm i' to install dependencies.
- Run 'npm i -g nodemon' to install nodemon globally.
- Run 'nodemon index.js' to start the dev server.

# Testing

To test your server individually, I recommend using Postman [https://www.postman.com/downloads/].
